# Java Socket Communication

This repository implements a Java-based socket communication system. The project demonstrates how to create a simple multithreaded server that handles multiple client connections using sockets. It is designed to provide a basic understanding of networking in Java and how server-client communication works.

## Features
- **Multithreaded Server**: The server can handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **Socket Communication**: Uses Java's `ServerSocket` and `Socket` classes for reliable TCP/IP communication.
- **Client Handler**: Each client is managed in a separate thread for concurrent processing.

## How It Works
1. The server listens on a specified port (e.g., `1357`) using `ServerSocket`.
2. When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and logs a message.
3. A `ClientHandler` object is created to manage communication with the client.
4. Each `ClientHandler` runs in a separate thread, enabling concurrent client management.

## Future Plans
I intend to extend this project by integrating a frontend interface and transforming it into a web application. This will involve:
- Adding a modern web-based user interface.
- Using the networking functionality implemented here as the backend for real-time client-server interactions.
- Enhancing the project to handle HTTP requests and responses for broader web application support.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-socket-communication.git
   ```
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```
   java Server
   ```
4. Connect clients to the server using a compatible socket client.
